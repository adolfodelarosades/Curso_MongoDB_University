# Final Exam

## Final: Question 1

**Problem:**

Which of the following are valid command line instructions to start a mongod? You may assume that all specified files already exist.
Attempts Remaining:Incorrect Answer

Check all answers that apply:

* `mongod --logpath /var/log/mongo/mongod.log --dbpath /data/db --fork` :+1:

* `mongod --dbpath /data/db --fork`

* `mongod --log /var/log/mongo/mongod.log --authentication`

* `mongod -f /etc/mongod.conf` :+1:

### See detailed answer

The correct answers are:

* `mongod --logpath /var/log/mongo/mongod.log --dbpath /data/db --fork`
 
* `mongod -f /etc/mongod.conf`

The following choices are incorrect:

* `mongod --dbpath /data/db --fork`

This is incorrect because a --logpath must be specified in order to fork the process.

* `mongod --log /var/log/mongo/mongod.log --authentication`

This is incorrect because both `--log` and `--authentication` are invalid flags - instead, they should say `--logpath` and `--auth`.


## Final: Question 2

**Problem:**

Given the following config file:

```sh
storage:
  dbPath: /data/db
systemLog:
  destination: file
  path: /var/log/mongod.log
net:
  bindIp: localhost,192.168.0.100
security:
  keyFile: /var/pki/keyfile
processManagement:
  fork: true
```

How many directories must MongoDB have access to? Disregard the path to the configuration file itself.


Choose the best answer:

* 3 :+1:

* 4 

* 2

* 1

### See detailed answer

The correct answer is **3**.

MongoDB must be able to access the data directory `/data/db/`, the log file `mongod.log` in `/var/log/`, and the keyfile `keyfile` in `/var/pki/`.

## Final: Question 3

At this moment, how many replica set members are eligible to become primary in the event of the current Primary crashing or stepping down?

Choose the best answer:

* 4

* 5 :+1:

* 6

* 7

### See detailed answer

The correct answer is **5**.

Because this is failover, the node that was primary is now unreachable. We can also see from the output that the member with `_id: 4` is also unreachable. That means 2 of the 7 nodes were unavailable, and that leaves us with 5 nodes eligible to become primary.

All other answers are incorrect. While the replica set is configured with 7 members, looking closely at the output we can see that one member is unreachable, specifically the member with `_id: 4`.

## Final: Question 4

**Problem:**

Given the following replica set configuration:

```sh
conf = {
  "_id": "replset",
  "version": 1,
  "protocolVersion": 1,
  "members": [
    {
      "_id": 0,
      "host": "192.168.103.100:27017",
      "priority": 2,
      "votes": 1
    },
    {
      "_id": 0,
      "host": "192.168.103.100:27018",
      "priority": 1,
      "votes": 1
    },
    {
      "_id": 2,
      "host": "192.168.103.100:27018",
      "priority": 1,
      "votes": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

What errors are present in the above replica set configuration?

Check all answers that apply:

* You cannot have three members in a replica set.

* You can only specify a `priority` of 0 or 1, member `"_id": 0` is incorrectly configured.

* You cannot specify two members with the same `_id`. :+1:

* You cannot specify the same host information among multiple members. :+1:

### See detailed answer

**Correct Answers**

* You cannot specify the same host information among multiple members.

Host information must be unique for each member in a replica set.

* You cannot specify two members with the same `_id`.

`_id` must be unique for each member in a replica set.

**Incorrect Answers**

* You can only specify a `priority` of 0 or 1, member `"_id": 0` is incorrectly configured.

Replica set members can have priority greater than 1, and this will increase the likelihood that a member becomes primary during an election (however, it cannot guarantee a node will become primary).

* You cannot have three members in a replica set.

Replica sets can have any number of members, although an odd number is recommended.

## Final: Question 5

**Problem:**

Given the following replica set configuration:

```sh
conf = {
  "_id": "replset",
  "version": 1,
  "protocolVersion": 1,
  "members": [
    {
      "_id": 0,
      "host": "localhost:27017",
      "priority": 1,
      "votes": 1
    },
    {
      "_id": 1,
      "host": "localhost:27018",
      "priority": 1,
      "votes": 1
    },
    {
      "_id": 2,
      "host": "localhost:27019",
      "priority": 1,
      "votes": 1
    },
    {
      "_id": 3,
      "host": "localhost:27020",
      "priority": 0,
      "votes": 0,
      "slaveDelay": 3600
    }
  ]
}
```

What is the most likely role served by the node with `"_id": 3`?

Choose the best answer:

* It serves to service reads and writes for people in the same geographic region as the host machine.

* It serves as a "hot" backup of data in case of accidental data loss on the other members, like a DBA accidentally dropping the database. :+1:

* It serves as a reference to perform analytics on how data is changing over time.

* It serves as a hidden secondary available to use for non-critical analysis operations.

### See detailed answer

The correct answer is:

It serves as a "hot" backup of data in case of accidental data loss on the other members, like a DBA accidentally dropping the database.

The node with `"_id": 3` is delayed by 1 hour. So if a DBA drops a database, that database will be dropped from all secondary nodes *without* a delay, but it will still be present on the node with `"_id": 3` for 1 hour.

All other answers are incorrect.

## Final: Question 6

Problem:

Given the following shard key:

```sh
{ "country": 1, "_id": 1 }
```

Which of the following queries will be routed (targeted)? Remember that queries may be routed to more than one shard.

Check all answers that apply:

* `db.customers.find({"_id": 914, "country": "Sweden"})` :+1:

* `db.customers.find({"country": "Norway", "_id": 54})` :+1:

* `db.customers.find({"country": { $gte: "Portugal", $lte: "Spain" }})` :+1:

* `db.customers.find({"_id": 455})`

### See detailed answer

The correct answers are:

* `db.customers.find({"country": "Norway", "_id": 54})`

This specifies both indexes used in the shard key.

* `db.customers.find({"country": { $gte: "Portugal", $lte: "Spain" }})`

This specifies a prefix of the indexes used in the shard key, **`"country"`**, and will be routed to shards containing the necessary information.

* `db.customers.find({"_id": 914, "country": "Sweden"})`

Although the indexes are specified in reverse order, this is a routed query. Any document matching `{"_id": 914, "country": "Sweden"}` **must** be identical to `{"country": "Sweden", "_id": 914}`. The query planner will take advantage of this and reorder the fields.

The incorrect answer is:

* `db.customers.find({"_id": 455})`

Because the neither a prefix nor the full shard key is provided, `mongos` has no way to determine how to appropriately route this query. Instead, it will send this query to all shards in the cluster in a *scatter-gather* operation.
